This role allows the office to observe successful practices that individual agencies develop but which other agencies may not be aware.In this role, OGIS is also able to see firsthand what works for requesters and what does not.&nbsp; Periodically, we will republish what we learn as best practices guides for requesters and agencies.&nbsp;If you have a best practice that you would like to suggest to OGIS, please send the Office an email and tell OGIS what has worked for you.</span></p>
