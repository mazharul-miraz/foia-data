These USDA officials represent that they will consider some opportunities to be “teachable moments,” rather than instances of non-compliance. Please provide copies of hand-written notes taken by USDA APHIS inspectors who inspected commercial dog breeding facilities located in the Missouri counties of Camden, Pulaski, Dallas, Laclede, Dent, Shannon, Reynolds, Polk, Lawrence, Webster, Wright, Carter, and Texas during the calendar year 2015. The notes I am requesting include notes taken by inspectors or veterinarians in notebooks or on note paper that the inspector or veterinarian took in order to aid him or her in drafting each breeder’s inspection report. Where applicable, please also provide copies of guidance documents or hand-written instructions given to these breeders outside of the official inspection report, including hand-written notes or memoranda, official guidance documents, informal or formal instructions, and memorialization of informal or formal consultations.
