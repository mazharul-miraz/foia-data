2013-APHIS-03004-F ,"Wolf, Susan ",- ,4/22/2013,5/20/2013,"The Regulatory Impact Analysis & Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (Analysis) issued April 2012 for Proposed Rule APHIS-2011-0003 RIN 0579-AD57, Pages 15 and 16 discuss Potentially Affected Small Entities. The Analysis states, “The entities affected by the proposed rule are likely to be considered small.” The Analysis further states, “The Small Business Administration (SBA) has established guidelines for determining which entities are to be considered small. Pet stores are identified in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) category 453910, Pet and Pet Supplies Stores. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in retailing pets, pet foods, and pet supplies. The small-entity standard for this industry is annual sales of not more than $19 million. In 2007, there were about 8,880 pet and pet supply stores in the United States.” In addition the Analysis states, “Establishments primarily engaged in retailing pets, pet foods, and pet supplies via electronic home shopping, mail-order, or direct sale are classified within NAICS subsector 454, Nonstore Retailers, and specifically, within NAICS category 4541112, Electronic Shopping, Specialized Merchandise. An entity in this category is considered small if it generates not more than $30 million in annual sales. In 2007, there were about 13,500 establishments in NAICS category 4541112, with average sales of $5.4 million.” The Analysis states on page 10, “Although we have attempted to estimate the impact of this proposed rule, we do not currently have enough information to fully assess it, particularly information on the number of entities that may be affected, or the breadth of operational changes that may occur at affected entities as a result.” APHIS properly identified the Proposed Rule to be “significant for the purposes of Executive Orders 12866 and 13563” and made the assumption that the affected entities were likely to be small entities, presumably as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA). Please provide copies of all correspondence between APHIS and offices of the Small Business Administration between May 2011 and May 2012 pertaining to the Proposed Rule and potential impact on small entities. Digital copies are preferred. Please advise if fees for providing the documents that I have requested will exceed $100.00 ",-
