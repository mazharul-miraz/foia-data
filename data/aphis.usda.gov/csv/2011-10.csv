The notice (per the Consent Decision, point #6) which was to be submitted before September 21, 2011 to the USDA from the respondents which explains the provisions of the order.

Specify all animals - puppies as well as breeding adult males/females, and if sold or donated to people/companies/organizations in Minnesota or to other states; 3. request the status of the dogs/puppies shipped to the Canine Culture Center in New York. Specifically, it appears that 168 puppies were shipped to the consignor location (per Certificates of Veterinary Medicine) listed as 36 East Broadway, NY, NY. However, this location appears to be a Meat Market and we have not found if the consignor ""Canine Culture Center"" exists. An email was sent to Dr. Goldentyer regarding this matter: Her email was that ""no animals were found to be in distress;"" however, we are getting conflicting information. Therefore, please send as data confirming the following: (1) if Canine Culture Center exists and, if possible, the owner; (2) if the puppies were, indeed, shipped to the above address and if they are healthy and safe, or, if not; (3) where the puppies were delivered, where they currently reside and if they are safe.
