Any report from inspectors. Really, any paperwork that the USDA APHIS has on Dean or Christy Riopelle and/or Masquerade Exotic Animals, LLC. I have been able to see the information on the two permits I listed above on the APHIS website, but the person I spoke with would not tell me if there were any other permits issued to this person/company/address so that I could look them up myself.
