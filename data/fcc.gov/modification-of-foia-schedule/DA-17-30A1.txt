Modification of the Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule
The Freedom of Information Act requires federal agencies to establish a schedule of fees
for the processing of requests for agency records in accordance with fee guidance issued by the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB).1 In 1987, OMB issued its Uniform Freedom of
Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines.2 However, because the FOIA requires that each
agency’s fees be based upon the direct cost incurred by the agency in providing FOIA services,3
OMB did not provide a unitary, government-wide schedule of fees.
The Commission bases its FOIA Fee Schedule on the grade level of the employee who 
processes the request.  See 47 C.F.R. § 0.467(a)(2). Thus, the Fee Schedule is computed at Step
5 of each grade level, based on the General Schedule effective January 1987 (including 20
percent for personnel benefits). The Commission’s rules provide that the Fee Schedule will be
modified periodically to correspond with modifications in the rate of pay approved by Congress. 
Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 0.467(a)(1) note, the Commission announces modifications to the hourly
fees by Public Notice, and posts the fee chart on its FOIA website, https://www.fcc.gov/reports-
research/guides/how-file-foia-request.
Accordingly, by this Public Notice we are modifying the Commission’s Freedom of
Information Act Fee Schedule. The Commission is revising the schedule of fees required by
Section 0.467 of its rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.467,4 for the recovery of the full, allowable direct costs
of searching for and reviewing agency records requested pursuant to the FOIA and the
Commission’s rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.460(e) and 0.461.  The revisions correspond to
modifications in the rate of pay approved by Congress for 2017.
1 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(i).
2 52 FR 10012 (March 27, 1987).
3 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iv).
4 These fees may be restricted or waived in accordance with 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A); 47 C.F.R.
§ 0.470(e).
The current FOIA Fee Schedule is as follows. Please note that these fees will be
modified periodically to correspond with modifications in the rate of pay approved by Congress.
