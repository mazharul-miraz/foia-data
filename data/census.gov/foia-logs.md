The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provides that any person has the right to request access to federal executive branch agency records or information. These federal agencies are required to disclose the records upon receiving a written request. Some records or parts of records may be protected from disclosure by any of the nine exemptions specified by FOIA or three exclusions. The three exclusions, which are rarely used, pertain to especially sensitive law enforcement and national security matters. The Justice Department is the agency responsible for coordinating the administration of the FOIA and encouraging agency compliance with it.  

Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests regarding Census Bureau records are handled through the Policy Coordination Office. The FOIA staff are responsible for reviewing, coordinating, and responding to requests coming to the Census Bureau that request records under the FOIA and Privacy Act (PA). The Policy Coordination Office will furnish a report to the public listing that will be updated quarterly that will entail the FOIA number and a description of the FOIA.
