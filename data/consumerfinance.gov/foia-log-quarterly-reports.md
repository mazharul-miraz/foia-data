# [FOIA Log Quarterly Reports](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/foia-requests/foia-electronic-reading-room/cfpb-foia-quarterly-reports/)  

On a quarterly basis, the CFPB is required to report four key FOIA statistics to the Department of Justice. This includes:
  the number of requests received during the reporting period
  the number of requests processed during the reporting period
  the number of requests in an agency’s backlog at the end of the reporting period
  the progress being made to close the agency’s ten overall oldest pending FOIA requests.  

This information is available here in two file types, json and xml, for download by the Department of Justice. A more user-friendly format is made available by DOJ on [www.FOIA.gov](http://www.FOIA.gov).
