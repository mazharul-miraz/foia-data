,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FOIA requests should be addressed to the Director of the Regional Archives where the records are located.  A listing of Regional Archives facility addresses can be found at www.archives.gov/locations/index.html.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FOR PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS SUBJECT TO FOIA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pursuant to the Presidential Records Act of 1978 (PRA), the records of former presidents, beginning with President Reagan, become subject to the provisions of the FOIA five years after the presidents leave office.  The incumbent or former president may continue to invoke specific restrictions for up to twelve years, after which only statutory FOIA restrictions may be applied (except that FOIA exemption (b)(5) does not apply to PRA records; however, the former and incumbent Presidents may assert executive privilege).  FOIA requests for Presidential records should be mailed to the attention of the Director of the Presidential library in which the records are located.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Presidential materials at pre-PRA Presidential libraries (Hoover through Carter) are donated collections (except that the Nixon materials are subject to a special statute) and are not subject to FOIA, but each of them have small collections of executive branch agency records that are subject to the FOIA.  Addresses of the Presidential Libraries are posted on our website at www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/index.html.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Judicial records, records of the Congress and legislative branch agencies, donated historical materials, and Nixon Presidential Historical Materials are not subject to the FOIA.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition, NARA cannot respond to FOIA requests for records that are in our physical but not legal custody, such as the records of executive branch agencies stored at a NARA administered Federal Records Center.  FOIA requests for record center holdings remain the responsibility of the originating agency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have published a FOIA Reference Guide that describes the procedures for making FOIA requests to NARA.  The Guide can be viewed at www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide.html.  Additional procedural information can be found in our implementing regulations at 36 CFR Part 1250 and 1254 through 1260.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B.                 Brief description of why some requests are not granted and an overview of certain general categories of the agency’s records to which the FOIA exemptions apply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NARA accepts FOIA requests for all executive branch records in its legal custody, including our own operational records and the historical records NARA maintains as the National Archives of the U.S. government. NARA asserts the privacy exemption more than the rest of the exemptions to protect the privacy of individuals referenced in records among our holdings.  NARA also uses Exemption (b)(1), as directed by equity holding agencies, to withhold information the release of which would harm the national security of the United States. Other reasons for not granting requests are outlined in Section V, B of this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
III.,"Acronyms, Definitions, and Exemptions",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A.                Agency specific acronyms or other terms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NARA - National Archives and Records Administration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Operational records – records that NARA creates or receives in carrying out its mission and responsibility as an executive branch agency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Archival records – permanent records of the United States government that have been transferred to the legal and physical custody of the National Archives of the United States and the Presidential Libraries.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance Measurement and Reporting System (PMRS) – the PMRS is the official source for statistical management information at NARA.  PMRS is a “data warehouse” application that collects and publishes data regarding NARA’s performance relative to the numeric goals outlined in the most current version of NARA’s Strategic Plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"B.                 Basic terms, expressed in common terminology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a.      Administrative Appeal – a request to a federal agency asking that it review at a higher administrative level a full denial or partial denial of access to records under the Freedom of Information Act, or any other FOIA determination such as a matter pertaining to fees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b.      Average number – the number obtained by dividing the sum of a group of numbers by the quantity of numbers in the group. For example, of 3, 7, and 14, the average number is 8. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c.       Backlog – the number of requests or administrative appeals that are pending at an agency at the end of the fiscal year that are beyond the statutory time period for a response.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d.      Component – for agencies that process requests on a decentralized basis, a “component” is an entity, also sometimes referred to as an Office, Division, Bureau, Center, or Directorate, within the agency that processes FOIA requests.  The FOIA now requires that agencies include in their Annual FOIA Report data for both the agency overall and for each principal component of the agency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e.       Consultation – the procedure whereby the agency responding to a FOIA request first forwards a record to another agency for its review because that other agency has an interest in the document.  Once the agency in receipt of the consultation finishes its review of the record, it responds back to the agency that forwarded it.  That agency, in turn, will then respond to the FOIA requester.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f.       Exemption 3 statute – a separate federal statute prohibiting the disclosure of a certain type of information and authorizing its withholding under FOIA subsection (b)(3). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"g.      FOIA/PA request – Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act request. A FOIA request is generally a request for access to records concerning a third party, an organization, or a particular topic of interest. A Privacy Act request is a request for records concerning oneself; such requests are also treated as FOIA requests. (All requests for access to records under these two statutes are included in this report. This report does not account for requests for archival records that do not cite the FOIA or Privacy Act.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h.      Full Grant – an agency decision to disclose all records in full in response to a FOIA request. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i.        Full Denial – an agency decision not to release any part of a record or records in response to a FOIA request because all the information in the requested records is determined by the agency to be exempt under one or more of the FOIA's exemptions, or for some procedural reason (such as because no record is located in response to a FOIA request). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"j.        Median number – the middle, not average, number. For example, of 3, 7, and 14, the median number is 7. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k.      Multi-track processing – a system in which simple requests requiring relatively minimal review are placed in one processing track and more voluminous and complex requests are placed in one or more other tracks. Requests in each track are processed on a first-in/first out basis. A requester who has an urgent need for records may request expedited processing (see below). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
                                                                                                        i.            Expedited processing – an agency will process a FOIA request on an expedited basis when a requester has shown an exceptional need or urgency for the records which warrants prioritization of his or her request over other requests that were made earlier. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
                                                                                                      ii.            Simple request – a FOIA request that an agency using multi-track processing places in its fastest (non expedited) track based on the volume and/or simplicity of records requested. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
                                                                                                    iii.            Complex request – a FOIA request that an agency using multi-track processing places in a slower track based on the volume and/or complexity of records requested. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"l.        Partial grant/Partial Denial – an agency decision to disclose a record in part in response to a FOIA request, deleting information determined to be exempt under one or more of the FOIA's exemptions; or a decision to disclose some records in their entireties, but to withhold others in whole or in part. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
m.    Pending Request or Pending Administrative Appeal – a request or administrative appeal for which an agency has not taken final action in all requests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"n.      ""Perfected"" request – a FOIA request for records which adequately describes the records sought, which has been received by the FOIA office of the agency or agency component in possession of the records, and for which there is no remaining question about the payment of applicable fees. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
o.      Processed Request or Processed Administrative Appeal – a request or appeal for which an agency has taken a final action on the request or the appeal in all respects. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
p.      Range in Number of Days – the lowest and highest number of days to process requests or administrative appeals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"q.      Time limits – the time period in the Freedom of Information Act for an agency to respond to a FOIA request (ordinarily 20 working days from proper receipt of a ""perfected"" FOIA request). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C.                The Nine FOIA Exemptions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The fees above represent fees collected in response to FOIA requests for NARA’s operational records.  NARA does not charge fees for document search or review of accessioned (archival) records. However, in accordance with 44 USC § 2116 (c), NARA charges standard fees to recover the costs of making reproductions in response to requests received by NARA. In our current system there is no way to distinguish reproductions made in response to FOIA requests from reproductions made in response to other types of requests (e.g., regular reference requests for open records and reproductions made on self-service copiers at NARA facilities).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

F.     Discussion of Other FOIA Activities ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.      Brief description of the agency’s response times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In FY10 NARA answered 1,502,637 written reference requests for access to records among NARA’s holdings. These requests seek records that are publicly available and have no restrictions to access. Of the over 1.5 million requests processed, NARA answered 1,026,693 requests within 10 working days. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The number of requests for open archival records does not include the 563,227 items furnished to researchers in NARA’s reading rooms across the country; the 3,582,978 visitors to NARA research rooms, museums, and public programs, including 136,734 persons who requested access to original records or microfilm for research purposes; the 39,036,307 online visits, including to archival holdings made available through the Access to Archival Databases (AAD), the Archival Research Catalogue (ARC), the Federal Register, or other online resources; or the 14,989 reproduction orders NARA received.   These numbers also do not take into account the voluminous number of telephone calls and onsite consultations NARA receives.  We provide these numbers to show that FOIA requests make up only a very small portion of the way in which NARA provides access to its records every year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While NARA has made strides to enhance performance on the processing of FOIA requests, we are still faced with significant challenges.  Like many government agencies, NARA faces budgetary and staffing limitations that impede our ability to meet FOIA goals.  There are also factors unique to NARA that contributes to NARA’s inability to fully comply with the FOIA’s statutory time limits:  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a.      FOIA’s for Official Military Personnel files take considerably longer than twenty working days to process if the request is for a record that was lost in the 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center and the data must be reconstructed from other sources, or if the record has been borrowed by another agency. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b.      NARA has very limited authority to declassify information.  The length of time to respond to a FOIA can be prolonged if the records must be sent to another agency for declassification review.  Indeed, all ten of NARA’s oldest pending requests and approximately 2,000 more are awaiting declassification review by other agencies, i.e., as “consultations,” and thus processing delays are outside of NARA’s control.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c.       When FOIA requests are submitted to Presidential Libraries that are subject to the Presidential Records Act and the FOIA, NARA must notify both the current and former President of the records we propose to open and then allow them an opportunity to review the records for executive privilege prior to release.  This process takes additional time in responding to such requests.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d.      NARA is still working to staff and implement the National Declassification Center (NDC).  This initiative will, over time, improve our ability to facilitate the review of classified records among our archival holdings that have been requested under the provisions of the FOIA, thereby, reducing our processing times for such requests.
